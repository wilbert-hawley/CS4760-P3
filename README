Program: monitor, producer, consumer
CS4760 - Assignment 3

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adjustments:
	- Did not implement the control-c interupt handler
	- Works most of the time. Had some issues with changing the number of consumer and producers. Sometimes breaks the process but I was unable to diagnose. 
	- May have to change the path variable in libmonitor.c after aborted attempt.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How To Run:
	- On command line: make
	- Check executable name (defualt should be monitor)
	- Run program with: ./monitor
	- For help, use -h option.
