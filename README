Program: monitor, producer, consumer
CS4760 - Assignment 3

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adjustments:
	- Did not implement the control-c interupt handler
	- Works about half  of the time. Had some issues with changing the number of consumer and producers. Sometimes breaks the process but I was unable to diagnose. 
	- May have to change the path variable in libmonitor.c after aborted attempt.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How To Run:
	- On command line: make
	- Check executable name (defualt should be monitor)
	- Run program with: ./monitor
	- For help, use -h option.
        - To change terminattion time, try -t time
        - To change number of consumers, try -c n
        - TO change number of producers, try -p m
        - To change logfile name, try -o file
        - Run make clean to clear out object files and logfile.
