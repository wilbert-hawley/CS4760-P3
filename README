Program: monitor, producer, consumer
CS4760 - Assignment 3

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Adjustments:
	- Did not implement the control-c interupt handler
	- Works about half  of the time. Had some issues with changing the number of consumer and producers. Sometimes breaks the process but I was unable to diagnose. 
	- May have to change the path variable in libmonitor.c after aborted attempt.
        - Had issues with randome sleep times. There is variable called random_flag which can be set to true if you wish to see the behavior with random sleep times for consumer and producer. 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

How To Run:
	- On command line: make
	- Check executable name (defualt should be monitor)
	- Run program with: ./monitor
	- For help, use -h option.
        - To change terminattion time, try -t time
        - To change number of consumers, try -c n
        - TO change number of producers, try -p m
        - To change logfile name, try -o file
        - Run make clean to clear out object files and logfile.

    Project is now working perfectly. I fixed the producers so that they sequentially detach them from shared memory and close. I need to fix the print statements, and then it should be finished.

    Implemented a semaphore into my monitor.c. I have confirmed it is opening and I am initializing all three emaphores without error. Next will be to implement the wait/post methods in my producer.c and consumer.c.

    Thanks to Prof Bhatia, I got my Makefile working with the static library. I also added consumer.c and producer.c, which compile and run correctly. Next up is setting up shared memory in monitor.c.

commit 7afafdecab8a1b395ca82675946d43a6263a03a7
Author: Wilbert Hawley <hawley@hoare7.cs.umsl.edu>

    Added the libmonitor files as specified by Bhatia on teams. I'm attempting to connect a static library to my main executable. The static library appears(?) to be created but the files have yet to link. I'm unable to call the fun() function found in the libmonitor library. Need to ask for help with how to get it connected before I move functions over there.
